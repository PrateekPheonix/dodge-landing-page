                            IThe Challenger's base 305-hp V-6 won't satisfy thrill seekers. The modest engine mates exclusively to the eight-speed
                            automatic, but in the heavy Challenger, it lacks the acceleration and excitement of rivals. The Dodge's Hemi V-8 engines
                            are another story. The 375-hp 5.7-liter we tested had plenty of juice to powerslide on demand, and its guttural growl
                            was gratifying. Those looking to maximize the Challenger's potential will want the 6.4-liter V-8, which produces 485
                            horsepower and 475 pound-feet of torque. We also drove the T/A 392 with the automatic and admired the exhaust's
                            cannon-blast startup sound and baritone roar when prodded. While we're suckers for a manual transmission, the ZF
                            automatic is incredibly responsive to throttle inputs, with quick power-on downshifts. The Challenger hustles through
                            corners like a raging bull seeing red, snorting aggressively and swaying threateningly. The burly Dodge is a muscle car
                            in the truest sense: It's better on the street and the drag strip than on two-lanes and road courses. Since the lineup's
                            redesign in 2015, the models we've driven have offered a compliant ride that's comfortable but a bit unrefined. Compared
                            with the sharper and stickier handling of the Camaro and Mustang, however, the Challenger is too soft in tight turns and
                            its steering is too numb. The slow-to-react helm is well suited to leisurely drives and easily controlled power-induced
                            tail slides.

                            The EPA estimates the 2021 Challenger with the V-6 and rear-wheel drive will earn 19 mpg city and 30 highway. Adding
                            all-wheel drive into the mix nixes those ratings by 1 and 3 mpg, respectively. Challengers with the 5.7-liter V-8 are
                            expected to earn up to 16 mpg city and 25 highway. Versions with the 6.4-liter V-8 are rated up to 15 mpg city and 24
                            highway. We've tested the all-wheel-drive V-6 Challenger and one with the 485-hp V-8 and automatic transmission on our
                            75-mph real-world route, which is part of our extensive testing regimen. Surprisingly, they both earned 26 mpg on the
                            highway.

                            The Challenger has a classic muscle-car interior, with a simple design inspired by its 1970s-era predecessors and
                            comfortable accommodations. Compared with its pony-car rivals, the Dodge is far roomier inside, and adults can actually
                            use the back seat. Unfortunately, its rubberized materials resemble old vinyl rather than premium plastic, and rear
                            visibility is lousy. The Challenger's broad front seats are comfortable for cruising, but even the optional seats, which
                            have added bolstering, don't hug their occupants the way those in the Camaro or Mustang do. Dodge's pony car has an
                            extra seven cubic feet of cargo space in its trunk versus the Camaro. This allows the Challenger to swallow two more
                            bags of luggage than the Camaro. Fold the back seats down and that advantage grows to six. The Challenger has a big
                            center-console bin and a useful spot for a smartphone. Still, none of the cars we tested in this class were particularly
                            adept at storing small items.
